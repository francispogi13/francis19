<body> <h1>life of a grade school student is different from the life of a college student.
 As a first year college student, it is so hard to adjust.
  It is so hard to catch up what is going through.
   College life humbled me, to the point I looked down upon myself.
    I came up with the idea that maybe college is not for me, but what I did is I continue and pursue.<h1>
     I can define myself as a dedicated person, a person who's willing and eager to acquire new knowledge.
      I am a student who's compassionate in achieving my goals in life. <br>
       I am a person who's motivated to achieve specific aspirations in life.
        As a student, actually I really do not know who I am. 
        </p>All I know I am a student with purpose, worth, and value.
        I choose information technology because I love playing computer since i am 9 years old. 
        Thats why I choose this course and i believe my self,what if i try? there's no wrong to try,
        If somebody can do this,well i can do this too.
        If this course will work on me them i will continue this field.
        And also i want to enchance my analytical skills,I want to learn coding and programming.</h1>
<h1>Every moment no matter how struggle and hard that I encounter, 
I would still be genuine and wise as well despite the hardest battles that I experience.
 And there are many opportunities what ever you want to apply.
